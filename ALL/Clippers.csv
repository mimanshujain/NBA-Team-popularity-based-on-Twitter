Thu May 07 04:38:59 +0000 2015,Are you a contender if Austin Rivers is playing crunch time minutes in meaningful playoff game? How shallow are the #Clippers. #NBAPlayoffs
Thu May 07 04:38:48 +0000 2015,Feel bad for Rivers. He almost made a great play  instead he ended up making a huge mistake that probably sealed the loss for the #Clippers.
